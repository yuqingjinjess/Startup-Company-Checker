# Startup-Company-Checker

Product Name: Startup Stability Checker 

Target Audience: Job seekers and employees evaluating startup offers. 

Core Value Proposition: Translate vague investor hype into concrete "Job Security" metrics using a 10-pillar analysis system. One-stop shop for learning about a new startup company

This tool helps to solve these user problems:
1. Job seekers struggle to assess if a startup will exist in 2-4 years (vesting period).
2. Investor metrics (valuation, hype) do not equal employee stability (runway, culture).
3. Users lack the financial literacy to interpret "burn rate" or "unit economics."
4. The threat of "Big Tech" (Google/Microsoft) copying a startup is an existential risk often ignored.
